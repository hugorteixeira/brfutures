\usage{
get_brfut_agg(
  start = NULL,
  end = NULL,
  root = NULL,
  treatment = "clean_data",
  rebuild_agg = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{start, end}{Date bounds. When omitted all cached rows are returned.}

\item{root}{Optional character vector restricting the returned roots. When
`NULL`, rows from every cached root are included.}

\item{treatment}{Either the name of a built-in treatment (e.g. `"standard"`,
`"regular"`, `"raw"`) or a function receiving the assembled aggregate data
frame and returning the desired shape. Defaults to `"clean_data"`, which
removes redundant bulletin columns, converts localized numeric strings to
numbers, and renames selected columns to clearer aliases (e.g.
`"preco_abert"` -> `"open"`). Use `"clean_data_drop0"` to additionally drop
rows where any key OHLC/V fields are zero or `NA`.}

\item{rebuild_agg}{When `TRUE`, rebuilds the cached aggregates from the
latest root files before loading. Defaults to `FALSE`.}
}
\value{
A data frame with every cached contract observation within the range.
