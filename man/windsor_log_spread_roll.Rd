\usage{
windsor_log_spread_roll(
  days_before_expiry = 20,
  clamp_ratio = c(0.6, 1.6),
  winsor = c(0.05, 0.95),
  roll_control = NULL,
  roll_stagger = 1L,
  contract_ranks = c(1L, 2L),

}
\arguments{
\item{days_before_expiry}{Business days prior to expiry to begin rolling.}

\item{clamp_ratio}{Lower/upper bounds applied to seam ratios.}

\item{winsor}{Probability cut-offs for the winsorisation step applied to log
spreads around the seam.}

\item{roll_control}{Optional list merged into the default roll control
settings. Recognised entries include `price_column` (seam column),
`target_days_to_maturity` (business-day tenor selection),
`target_days_tolerance` (permitted deviation when searching for the target),
`target_side` (`"nearest"`, `"forward"`, or `"backward"` preference), and
`target_calendar` (optional `bizdays` calendar object overriding the
package default).}

\item{roll_stagger}{Number of business days used to stagger the roll.}

\item{contract_ranks}{Which contract ranks to stitch (defaults to front/next).}

\item{include_roll_details}{When `TRUE`, enrich the daily output with roll
diagnostics.}
