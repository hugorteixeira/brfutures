\usage{
build_forward_adjusted(
  data,
  root,
  days_before_roll = 5,
  maturities = "all",
  add_root = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{Data frame with daily contract quotes as returned by
`get_brfut_agg()` (must contain `date`, `root`, `ticker`, `maturity`,
and OHLC columns).}

\item{root}{Character scalar with the primary contract root (e.g. "WIN").}

\item{days_before_roll}{Non-negative integer indicating how many calendar
days before maturity the function should roll into the next contract.}

\item{maturities}{Either "all" (default) to allow every listed maturity or
a character vector with month codes (e.g. `c("F", "G", "H")`).}

\item{add_root}{Optional character vector with additional roots to treat as
extensions of `root` (useful for historical naming changes).}
}
\value{
An OHLCV `xts` object with attributes describing the roll schedule
  and active contracts.
}
\description{
Generates a continuous futures curve that preserves the early history of the
front contract and scales forward contracts to avoid price gaps after each
roll.
}
